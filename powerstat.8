.SH NAME
powerstat \- a tool to measure power consumption
.br

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B powerstat
[options]
.RI [ delay " [" count ]]
.br

.SH DESCRIPTION
powerstat is a program that measures the power consumption of a computer
that has a battery power source or supports the RAPL (Running Average Power
Limit) interface.  The output is like vmstat but also shows power
consumption statistics.  At the end of a run, powerstat will calculate
the average, standard deviation and min/max of the gathered data.
.br

Note that running powerstat as root will provide extra information about
processes that have fork'd, exec'd and exited.

.SH OPTIONS
powerstat options are as follow:
.TP
.B \-b
redo a sample measurement if a system is busy, the default for busy is considered less than 98% CPU idle. The CPU idle threshold can be altered using the \-i option.
.TP
.B \-d delay
specify delay before starting, default is 180 seconds when running on battery or 0 seconds when using RAPL. This gives the machine time to settle down and for the battery readings to stabilize.
.TP
.B \-D
enable extra power stats showing all the power domain power readings. This currently only applies to the \-R RAPL option.
.TP
.B \-h
show help.
.TP
.B \-H
show histogram of power measurements.
.TP
.B \-i threshold
specify the idle threshold (in % CPU idle) to force a re-sample measurement if the CPU is less idle than this level. This option implicitly enables the \-b option.
.TP
.B \-p
redo a sample measurement if any processes fork(), exec() or exit().
.TP
.B \-r
redo if system is not idle and any processes fork(), exec() or exit(), an alias for \-p \-b.
.TP
.B \-R
read power statistics from the RAPL (Running Average Power Limit) domains. This is supported
by recent Linux kernels and Sandybridge and later Intel processors.  This only covers some
of the hardware in the machine, such as the processor package, DRAM controller, CPU core
(power plane 0), graphics uncore (power plane 1) and so forth, so the readings do not cover
the entire machine.
.br
Because the  RAPL readings are accurate and available immediately, the start delay (\-d option)
is defaulted to zero seconds.
.TP
.B \-s
this dumps a log of the process fork(), exec() and exit() activity on completion.
.TP
.B \-S
use standard averaging to calculate power consumption instead of using
a 120 second rolling average of capacity samples. This is only useful
if the battery reports just capacity values and is an alternative method
of calculating the power consumption based on the start and current battery
capacity.
.TP
.B \-z
forcibly ignore zero power rate readings from the battery, don't use this unless you know what you are doing.
