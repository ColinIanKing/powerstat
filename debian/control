Description: laptop power measuring tool
 Powerstat measures the power consumption of a mobile PC that has
 a battery power source.  The output is like vmstat but also shows
 power consumption statistics.  At the end of a run, powerstat 
 will calculate the average, standard deviation and min/max of
 the gathered data.
